    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a new self-taught front-end developer. I graduated from UC San Diego in 2021 with a B.A. in International Business. Previously, I was working as a business developemnt rep at Oracle NetSuite. I decided that it was not for me and I wanted to seek out other opportunities. That's when I seriously considered learning how to code and ended up falling in love with it. The power to design and create with something that boils down to ones and zeros facinated me. I started out learning SQL and Python before realizing that I was more interested in front-end and soon began to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Thank you for taking a look at my website and please reach out with any opportunites!
